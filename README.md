# Irsis Flowers
Iris Flower Detection Using Logistic Regression
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements using logistic regression.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and identifying patterns.

Model Training: Implementing logistic regression for multi-class classification.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Techniques to address class imbalance.

Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-detection.git
cd iris-flower-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation: Place your dataset in the data folder.

Run Preprocessing: Execute the preprocessing script to clean and transform the data.

bash
python preprocessing.py
Train Model: Run the training script to build and evaluate the logistic regression model.

bash
python train_model.py
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Iris flower dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
